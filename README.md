MOA (Mother of All) is a database abstraction using [Active Record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern) pattern:

> Active record is an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class. Thus, an object instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the database. When an object is updated the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for each column in the table or view.

â€“ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern

MOA is designed to handle [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations.

MOA is not [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). MOA does not work with object relations and dependencies. However, these libraries do:

* [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/)
* [Propel](http://propelorm.org/)

MOA does not implement elaborate finders, filters or methods for querying data. However, these libraries do:

* [PHP ActiveRecord](https://github.com/jpfuentes2/php-activerecord)
* [Paris](https://github.com/j4mie/paris)
* [Parm](https://github.com/cassell/Parm)

## Hierarchy & Responsibilities

### Model Builder

MOA is using dynamic code generation to represent your database. [builder script](#building-models) generates a file for each table using attributes fetched from the database (e.g. column name, type, default value, etc.). These classes are generated dynamically to reduce the amount of hand-coded duplication of the data representation.

This is an example of generated class:

```php
/**
 * This class is generated using https://github.com/gajus/moa.
 * Do not edit this file; it will be overwritten.
 */
abstract class Greedy extends \Gajus\MOA\Mother {
    const TABLE_NAME = 'greedy';
    const PRIMARY_KEY_NAME = 'id';

    static protected
        $columns = [
            'id' => [
                'column_type' => 'int(10) unsigned',
                'column_key' => 'PRI',
                'column_default' => NULL,
                'data_type' => 'int',
                'is_nullable' => false,
                'extra' => 'auto_increment',
                'character_maximum_length' => NULL,
            ],
            'name' => [
                'column_type' => 'varchar(100)',
                'column_key' => '',
                'column_default' => '',
                'data_type' => 'varchar',
                'is_nullable' => false,
                'extra' => '',
                'character_maximum_length' => 100,
            ],
        ];
}
```

With other Active Record implementations you do not need a generator because these properties are either hand-typed or fetched during the execution of the code. The former is tedious and error-prone, while the latter is a lazy-workaround that has a considerable performance hit.

### Mother

All models extend `Gajus\MOA\Mother`. Mother attempts to reduce number of scenarios that would otherwise cause an error only at the time of interacting with the database. This is achived by using the prefetched table attributes to work out when:

* Accessing a non-existing property.
* Setting proprety that does not pass in-built and custom validation logic.
* Saving object without all the required properties.

In addition to the above, Mother is tracking object state for changes and does not synchronise with the database unless object state has changed.

### Hierarchy

As a result, project hierarchy is:

```
Gajus\MOA\Mother
    Your\Base [optional]
        MOA generated models
            your hand-typed models [optional]
                your hand-typed domains [optional, for dealing with ORM]
```

## Naming convention

MOA assumes that your models are writen using CamelCase convention (e.g. `MyTableName`). Table names must be singular (e.g. `Car` not `Cars`). MOA generated models will use CamelCase convention.

## Example

```php
<?php
$car = new \My\App\Model\Car($db); // $db is PDO instance
$car['colour'] = 'red';
$car->save();

echo $car['id']; // Newly entered record ID.
```

## Extending

### Mother

To inject logic between Mother and the generated models, you need to:

1. Extend `Gajus\MOA\Mother` class.
2. Build models using `--extends` property with the name of that class.

### Individual models

Models generated using MOA are `abstract`. You need to extend all models before you can use them:

```php
<?php
namespace My\App\Model;

class Car extends \Dynamically\Generated\Car {
    static public function getLastBought (\PDO $db) {
        $car = $db->query("SELECT `" . static::$properties['primary_key_name'] . "` FROM `" . static::$properties['table_name'] . "` ORDER BY `purchase_datetime` DESC LIMIT 1");
        
        return new static::__construct($db, $car[static::$properties['primary_key_name']]);
    }

    static public function getManyWhereColour (\PDO $db, $colour) {
        $sth = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM `" . static::$properties['table_name'] . "` WHERE `colour` = ?");
        $sth->execute([ $colour ]);

        return $sth->fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    }
}
```

> MOA convention is to prefix method names "getMany[Where]" for methods that return array and "get[Where]" that return instance of Mother.

You don't need to set anything else since all of the properties are already populated in the generated model. To view what properties are available for each table, refer to the generated models.

## Building models

Models are built using `./bin/build.php`  script, e.g. unit testing dependencies in this repository are built using:

```bash
php ./bin/build.php --namespace "Sandbox\Model\MOA" --database "moa" --path "./tests/Sandbox/Model/MOA"
```

### Parameters

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`path`|[required] Path to the directory where the models will be created.|
|`database`|[required] MySQL database name.|
|`host`|MySQL database host.|
|`user`|MySQL database user.|
|`password`|MySQL database password.|
|`namespace`|[required] PHP class namespace;|
|`extends`|PHP class to extend. Defaults to "\Gajus\MOA\Mother".|

All `.php` files will be deleted from the destination `path`. The destination `path` must have an empty `.moa` file. This requirement is a measure to prevent accidental data loss.
